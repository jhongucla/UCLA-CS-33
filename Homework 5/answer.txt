B. The trajectory is safe since it doesn't enter the unsafe region.
C. The trajectory is unsafe because L2 causes it to enter the unsafe region.

12.24:

ssize_t rio_readn(int df, void *usrbuf, size_t n);
Reentrant because it doesn't use global variables 

ssize_t rio_writen(int fd, void *usrbuf, size_t n);
Reentrant because it doesn't use global variables 

void rio_readinitb(rio_t *rp, int fd);
Non-reentrant because it uses a global struct

static ssize_t rio_read(rio_t *rp, char *usrbuf, size_t n);
Non-reentrant because it has a static return value

ssize_t rio_readlineb(rio_t *rp, void *usrbuf, size_t maxlen);
Non-reentrant because it uses a global struct

ssize_t rio_readnb(rio_t *rp, void *usrbuf, size_t n);
Non-reentrant because it uses a global struct
